You are tasked with developing a Fastapi-based web application dashboard tailored for administrative management. The dashboard should include the following features and adhere to the outlined specifications:

**Core Features:**

1.	**WhatsApp API Metrics Monitoring:**

•	Integrate with the WhatsApp API to fetch and display metrics including:

•	Number of users.

•	Engagement data (e.g., interactions per message, types of interactions).

•	Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize these metrics in real-time.

•	Allow filters (e.g., by date, interaction type).

2.	**User Management:**

•	Create a user management module with functionalities for:

•	Editing user preferences. (user key will be the phone number)

•	Deleting users upon request.

•	Implement search and filter capabilities for the user list.

3.	**News Source URL Management:**

•	Develop a section for managing news source URLs:

•	Add or remove news source URLs for automated news collection.

•	Include validations for URL input to ensure proper formatting.

•	Display a table with existing sources and actions for editing or deleting.

4.	**Message Sending via WhatsApp Bot:**

•	Implement a feature for the InfoAmazonia team to:

•	Send messages to user groups via the WhatsApp Bot.

•	Include message templates, personalization options, and scheduling capabilities.

5.	**Engagement Metrics Extraction:**

•	Extract engagement metrics such as:

•	Click-through rates (CTR).

•	Subscriptions in this week.

•	New subscriptions.

•	Messages sent and received.

•	Include data validation steps to ensure accuracy.

6.	**Metrics Visualization:**

•	Create dashboards to visualize engagement metrics.

•	Use charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) for presenting trends and comparisons.

**Technical Requirements:**

7. **Project Setup**

•	Add a fake data in all models 

•	Follow the snippet provided to build the first version of the fastapi-admin with auth

•	Use the same model structure provided in context

•	**Backend:**

•	FastApi framework for API integration and backend logic. use fastapi-admin abstraction to code the crud features for simplification

•	SQLAlchemy for database management (PostgreSQL).

•	Use flask-admin library

•	**Frontend:**

•	Use flask-admin library

•	Use templates with Jinja2 for server-side rendering.

•	Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI design.

•	Chart.js or Plotly for data visualization.

•	**Authentication:**

•	Implement user authentication.

•	Role-based access control for admin and team members.

•	**Deployment:**

•	Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Railway).

•	Use Docker for containerization and easy deployment.


**Expected Outcome:**

A functional and visually appealing FastApi web app dashboard for InfoAmazonia’s administrative tasks, enabling seamless monitoring, management, and engagement functionalities.
